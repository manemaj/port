Project Name:

Motion Control Robotic End-effector


Objective:

Create DSLR camera-holding motion-control end-effector using the 6-th axis for pulling focus. Reuse discarded Denso 6-axis industrial robotic arms.


Challenges:

Create a complex assembly using an existing focus-pulling gearbox, DSLR Camera and rail system. Dealing with machining, fitment of existing precision components, programming outdated robotic arms. Making the entire system operational.

Result:

Point-to-point motion control resulting in pretty smooth video. Limited range of motion defined by physical dimensions of the robots. Further optimization/programming required. Learning how to deal with complexity and how it effects the timing of a given project.
